<hr/>

it's for understanding how gradient descent work using TF

and also, understanding Linear regression with, without TF

i referred some of idea from https://www.kaggle.com/pramodkumar8/gradient-descent/

if you following the codes line by line in main.ipynb as jupyter notebook or other things

i'm sure you will understand, about Linear regression as i did
